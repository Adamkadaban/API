If you recieve the above error it means that you did not attach a semantic (sem) version (ver) label to your PR.

### Adding a Semantic Version Label

1) Click the gear icon by `Labels` on the right hand side of your PR.

2) Choose between the labels: `major`, `minor`, and `patch`. If you are unsure which one to choose, see the summary section at the top of the page of this [semantic versioning guide](https://semver.org/).

3) As soon as you add the label, it will kick off the check once again which should pass.
